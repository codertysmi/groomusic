# GrooMusic

It is an application to create rooms where people can listen to music in a synchronized way,


##  Current State

Currently the current version is not working properly, this is because I am redoing the backend in golang, to make the application faster and cheaper to maintain.
The stable version ~~https://groomusic.xyz/~~ has been stopped, if you want to see the progress of the application use this link http://206.189.53.145/
